# HTTP-or-HTTPS
This tool will check if the provided url is alive or not. If alive, is it HTTP or HTTPS.
It will check for the doamins inside the text file.
The logic behind this tool is that, we will visit the domain as http, if it has response code of 301/302, then it's moved to HTTPS. If its 200 its alive but http only.
